## Description  
An app where gamers can keep track of their game collections, and get suggestions on what to play based on game type and console via a random 'roulette' generator.
## Demo

## Notes for TA  
Guests can only view a list of games. Create an account to see full functionality -- search and add games to your collection, create and edit games, and request a random suggestion for what to play based on game category or console by visiting the 'Roulette' tab.  
  
For CRUD operations, creating, reading and editing are all included. Given that the games are shared, it did not make sense to allow users to completely delete a game from the database that another user might have in their collection. They can be removed from the user's collection, which serves as deleting from the user's perspective.
